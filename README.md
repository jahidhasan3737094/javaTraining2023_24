# steps to run:
<h2>There are three classes and they are : </h2>
<h3>Main</h3>
<h3>Util</h3>
<h3>UserRegistration</h3>
<p>Main class is to run the program where has the main method </p>
<p>JavaFolder this is the directory that I provide the name to create and to 
save the JSON file inside</p>
<p>lib directory is where you will find the required JSON jar file that you need to add to your program module.
if you don't have the jar file you can downlad the jar file .
to add with your program you need to first 
go to your "<i>project structure</i>,you need to click on the <i>libraries</i> which is under of <i>project sitting</i> tab on the leftside.Then click on the "+" next click on java and find the jar file directory on your system.then click <i>Apply</i> and click Ok. </p>
<h4>To open project structure shortcut key->  <i>ctrl+alt+shift+s</i> .</h4>

### Exercise 1: Basic Inheritance

Create a class Animal with properties name and age. Then, create two subclasses, Dog and Cat, that inherit from Animal. Add a method makeSound() in each subclass to print the sound each animal makes.

### Exercise 2: Method Overriding

Extend the previous example by adding a method printInfo() in the Animal class that prints the name and age of the animal. Override this method in both Dog and Cat classes to include additional information specific to each type of animal.

### Exercise 3: Constructor Chaining

Create a class Vehicle with properties make and year. Extend the Vehicle class to create a subclass Car. Use constructor chaining to ensure that when a Car object is created, both the Vehicle and Car constructors are called.

### Exercise 4: Abstract Classes

Create an abstract class Shape with an abstract method calculateArea(). Extend this class to create two subclasses, Circle and Rectangle, and implement the calculateArea() method in each subclass.

### Exercise 5: Polymorphism

Create a class Employee with a method calculateSalary() that prints the basic salary. Extend this class to create two subclasses, Manager and Developer. Override the calculateSalary() method in each subclass to include additional bonuses or incentives.

### Exercise 6: Interface Implementation

Create an interface Playable with a method play(). Implement this interface in two classes, Guitar and Piano. In each implementation, print a message indicating the instrument being played.

### Exercise 7: instanceof Operator

Create a method displayAnimalType(Animal animal) that takes an Animal object as a parameter and uses the instanceof operator to determine whether the animal is a Dog or a Cat. Print an appropriate message based on the type of animal.

### Exercise 8: Super Keyword

Create a class Person with properties name and age. Extend this class to create a subclass Student with an additional property grade. Use the super keyword to invoke the constructor of the Person class from the Student class constructor.

### Exercise 9: Multiple Inheritance

Create an interface Flyable with a method fly(). Extend the Bird class from Exercise 1 to implement the Flyable interface. Create a FlyingFish class that extends the Fish class from Exercise 1 and implements the Flyable interface.

### Exercise 10: Access Modifiers
